# **Timeless Treasures  ðŸ“¸**

# **Project Description**

The final Sky project entailed the design of a web application that utilized front-end and back-end programming languages. 
My team and I developed a responsive web application for a photography service that allows users to view our services and packages, 
use a quote calculator to receive a quote, and use a contact form to submit queries or request tailored services.

We have connected our contact form to a MySQL database and also rendered the data to an HTML page for easy and secure access.
